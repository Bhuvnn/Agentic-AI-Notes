1-> Agentic AI:
        Agentic AI is a type of AI that can take actions autonomously to achieve specific goals. 
        Unlike traditional AI systems that require human intervention for decision-making, 
        agentic AI can perceive its environment, make decisions, and execute actions independently.
        This capability allows agentic AI to operate in dynamic and complex environments, adapting to changes 
        and learning from experiences.

2-> Key Characteristics of Agentic AI:
        a. Autonomy: Agentic AI can operate without human intervention, making decisions based on its programming and learned experiences.
        b. Goal-Oriented: It is designed to achieve specific objectives, which can range from simple tasks to complex problem-solving.
        c. Adaptability: Agentic AI can learn from its environment and experiences, allowing it to improve its performance over time.
        d. Interaction: It can interact with other systems, humans, and its environment to gather information and execute actions.

3-> Applications of Agentic AI:
        a. Robotics: Agentic AI is used in autonomous robots that can navigate and perform tasks in various environments, such as manufacturing, healthcare, and exploration.
        b. Virtual Assistants: AI-powered virtual assistants can manage schedules, send reminders, and perform tasks on behalf of users.
        c. Autonomous Vehicles: Self-driving cars utilize agentic AI to perceive their surroundings, make decisions, and navigate safely.
        d. Game AI: In video games, agentic AI controls non-player characters (NPCs) that can adapt to player actions and provide a more immersive experience.
        e. Smart Home Systems: Agentic AI can manage home automation systems, adjusting lighting, temperature, and security based on user preferences and behaviors.


4-> components of Agentic AI:
        a. Brain: The central processing unit of the agentic AI that handles perception, decision-making, and learning. It integrates data from various sources and applies algorithms to determine the best course of action.
        b. Orchestrators: These components manage the overall workflow of the agentic AI, coordinating between different modules and ensuring that tasks are executed in a logical sequence.
        c. Executors: The parts of the system responsible for carrying out actions based on decisions made by the brain. This can include controlling physical devices or executing software commands.
        d. Sensors: These are the input mechanisms that allow the agentic AI to perceive its environment. They can include cameras, microphones, and other data-gathering tools that provide real-time information for decision-making.


5-> Agentic AI vs Generative AI vs traditional AI:
        a. Traditional AI: Traditional AI systems are typically rule-based and require human input for decision-making. They follow predefined algorithms and lack the ability to adapt or learn from new experiences.
        b. Generative AI: Generative AI focuses on creating new content, such as images, text, or music, based on learned patterns from existing data. While it can produce novel outputs, it does not possess the autonomy to take actions or make decisions independently.
        c. Agentic AI: In contrast, agentic AI is autonomous and goal-oriented, capable of perceiving its environment, making decisions, and executing actions without human intervention. It combines elements of learning and adaptability to operate effectively in dynamic settings.

6-> Downsides and Challenges of Agentic AI:
        a. Ethical Concerns: The autonomy of agentic AI raises ethical questions about accountability, especially in scenarios where AI actions lead to unintended consequences.
        b. Security Risks: Autonomous systems can be vulnerable to hacking and malicious attacks, potentially leading to harmful outcomes.
        c. Job Displacement: The deployment of agentic AI in various industries may lead to job losses as tasks traditionally performed by humans are automated.
        d. Complexity and Cost: Developing and maintaining agentic AI systems can be complex and expensive, requiring significant resources and expertise.

7-> Difficulties in creating Agentic AI:
        a. Complexity of Decision-Making: Developing algorithms that can make complex decisions in real-time is challenging, especially in unpredictable environments.
        b. Safety and Ethics: Ensuring that agentic AI systems operate safely and ethically is a significant concern, particularly in applications like autonomous vehicles and healthcare.
        c. Learning and Adaptation: Creating AI that can effectively learn from its environment and experiences without unintended consequences is a complex task.
        d. Integration with Existing Systems: Agentic AI must often interact with other systems and technologies, requiring seamless integration and compatibility.
