      "*   **A. Hook:**\n",
      "    *   Start with an evocative question or statement about primal fear, the unknown, or insignificance.\n",
      "    *   *Example:* \"Ever felt a chill that wasn't from the cold? A creeping sense that humanity is but a fleeting flicker in a vast, indifferent cosmos?\"\n",

      "    *   Describe R'lyeh as the cyclopean, non-Euclidean city where Cthulhu lies dreaming \"dead but dreaming.\"\n",
